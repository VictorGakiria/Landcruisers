        The Land Cruiser 80 series was unveiled in October 1989 at 
        the Tokyo Motor Show and launched in early 1990. It had swing-out back doors, 
        which were replaced by a tailgate and hatch in 1994. The Land Cruiser was 
        nicknamed the Burbuja (Bubble) in Colombia and Venezuela due to its roundness. 
        The J80 was initially offered in two versions in these countries: the fully 
        loaded VX

        and an entry level model that included a vinyl interior with 
        ptional air conditioning. In 1996, the entry model was upgraded to a medium 
        equipped model named Autana, including cloth upholstery, standard air conditioning
         and power driver seat. The name is a reference to the Tepui mesa Autana, a
          spectacular plateau and cave system along the Guiana Shield craton. Land Cruiser 
        sales reached 2 million vehicles.

        <h id="two">100 series</h>
        <br>
        In January 1998, the 100 series Land Cruiser was introduced to 
        replace the 8-year-old 80 series. The 100 series was 
        previewed in October 1997 as the "Grand Cruiser" at the 32nd Tokyo Motor Show. Development began in 1991 under code name 404T, with the final design being frozen in mid-1994.[43][44]

There are two distinct versions of the 100-series, the 100 
and the 105. The two versions look very similar, but there are 
significant differences under the bodywork. Despite these differences 
and official model names, both the 100 and 105 are collectively known 
as the 100 series.

In 2002, a 5-year development plan on a successor to the 100-series 
platform commenced under Sadayoshi Koyari and Tetsuya Tada. By 2004, 1
0 years after the design selection of its predecessor in 1994, a final 
production design was settled on for the 2008 J200. Prototype related 
tests were conducted for over 2 years between 2004 and early 2007.

The redesigned Toyota Land Cruiser was introduced in late 2007.
 Known as the 200 Series, it shares the Lexus LX 570's platform and 
 overall design. The frame was new, derived from the second-generation
  Tundra[citation needed] but shortened and strengthened by 20 percent.
   Bigger brake rotors and calipers were added and the front suspension
    was strengthened. The underbelly is also protected by skid plates. 
    The roof pillars were redesigned to better protect occupants in a 
    rollover.

    <br>
    he J300 series Land Cruiser was unveiled on 9 June 2021.[71] 
    Its development was led by Toyota chief engineer Takami Yokoo.[74] 
    Built on the body-on-frame GA-F platform, the frame itself was 
    redesigned to reduce weight and increase rigidity. The total weight
     of the vehicle was reduced by 200 kg (441 lb) compared to its 
     predecessor. Other improvements claimed include lowered center 
     of gravity, weight distribution, and an improved suspension 
     structure.
